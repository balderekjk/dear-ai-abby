    "concern": "I have been concerned about my parents for some time now. They are elderly and live in a retirement community. They have a very nice home and don't have to worry about money.\n\nThe problem is, they drink every day -- sometimes from noon to when they go to bed. Many times, their drinking has caused arguments and police visits. When I express my concern about their drinking, they tell me to stay out of it, mind my own business, and they're retired and have earned the right to do whatever they want.\n\nI don't mind them having cocktails every now and then, but this has gotten out of hand. I think they have become alcoholics and only bad things are coming of it. They refuse to listen to me, or anybody else, for that matter. What should I do?",
    "abbyResponse": "As people age, their bodies are sometimes less able to metabolize alcohol than they were when they were younger. When things get out of hand to the extent that the police are being called, I agree something must be done. Because there is this level of disruption going on, it follows that the neighbors in that very nice retirement community must be less than thrilled.,\n\nThat your parents drink is only part of the problem. Elderly people can suffer from balance problems even when they are sober. It is common for someone who is inebriated to fall, which could cause your mom or dad to suffer serious injury.,\n\nIf other family members are also worried about your folks, an intervention might be in order. Before attempting one, attend some Al-Anon meetings so you can listen to others' similar experiences and learn how they were handled. Visit www.al-anon.alateen.org, or call 1-888-4-ALANON to find a meeting near you.",
    "aiResponse": "It sounds like you are in a very difficult situation and are concerned about your parents' well-being. It can be frustrating and heartbreaking when loved ones refuse to listen to our concerns or make changes that we believe are necessary for their health and safety.\n\nThere are a few things you can try in this situation:\n\n1.  Seek support for yourself: It can be emotionally draining to try to help someone who is not ready to accept help. Make sure to take care of yourself and seek support from friends, family, or a professional therapist to help you cope with the stress and frustration you are feeling.\n\n2.  Gather information and resources: Learn more about alcoholism and how to approach the subject with your parents. There are many resources available, such as the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (NCADD) and Al-Anon, a support group for family and friends of alcoholics.\n\n3.  Have a calm and non-confrontational conversation with your parents: It may be helpful to have a conversation with your parents about your concerns in a calm and non-judgmental way. Avoid lecturing or criticizing them, and instead focus on expressing your love and concern for them. Let them know that you are available to support them if they decide they want to make a change.\n\n4.  Consider staging an intervention: If your efforts to communicate with your parents have not been successful, you may want to consider staging an intervention with the help of a professional interventionist. An intervention is a structured process in which a person's friends and family confront the person about their problem behavior and offer support and assistance in seeking treatment.\n\nIt's important to remember that ultimately, the decision to change their behavior is up to your parents. You can offer support and encouragement, but you cannot force them to make a change."

    "concern": "My daughter says her children, ages 11 and 8, are afraid of me because I correct their lack of manners. Is asking them to say \"please\" and \"thank you,\" or to use a knife to cut things on their plate into small pieces rather than have food hanging out of their mouths, really expecting too much?\n\nIf their parents don't care, who will teach them? While I no longer expect people to keep their arms off the table, what are the minimal standards I should expect at a dinner table these days? Or am I expected to watch slobs sprawled over the table, picking at their food with their hands and chewing with their mouths open?",
    "abbyResponse": "Sometimes it isn't what we say, as much as how we say it. I see nothing wrong with reminding children to use their manners and explaining what they are. But if you are doing it in such a way that your grandchildren are afraid of you, it may be time to work on your delivery.",
    "aiResponse": "It is not unreasonable to expect children to have basic table manners, such as using utensils and saying \"please\" and \"thank you.\" These are important social skills that help children interact with others in a respectful and polite way. It is understandable that you want to teach your grandchildren good manners and that you may feel frustrated if they are not using them.\n\nThat being said, it is important to remember that children, especially young ones, may not always remember to use good manners, especially if they are not used to being corrected or if they have not had much practice using them. It is important to be patient and to remember that children learn through repetition and positive reinforcement.\n\nOne way to teach good table manners is to model the behavior you want to see. When you are at the dinner table, use good manners yourself and make a point to thank others for passing the food or for cooking the meal. You can also give your grandchildren gentle reminders to use good manners, such as saying \"Remember to say 'please' when you ask for something.\"\n\nIt is also important to remember that children may be afraid of you if you are consistently correcting their behavior or if you are overly critical. It may be helpful to try to find a balance between setting expectations for behavior and being understanding and patient with your grandchildren as they learn and grow."

He is also divorced, with a 13-year-old daughter.\n\nWe have tried to be sensitive and understanding about their feelings about our recent divorces and our relationship, but both girls are having a difficult time coping with it. We are very loving and inclusive, so it's not as if they should feel resentful or left out. But this is starting to cause a rift in our relationship.\n\nThere comes a point when they need to understand that this is the new norm and get used to it. We try to include each other's daughter in shared events, but it ends up becoming a forced struggle. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
    "abbyResponse": "Welcome to the world of blended families. As much as we would wish it, the adjustment isn't always smooth, because when children are involved, their world is often torn apart.\n\nA resource that can be helpful would be the Stepfamily Foundation Inc. (stepfamily.org). Your former spouses can also ease the adjustment for the girls by remaining actively involved in their lives, curbing their hostility and not pitting the children against either of you.\n\nHowever, if that's not in the cards, then enlist the help of a licensed family therapist. Blended family counseling, divorce and remarriage counseling may be necessary to ease the girls' transition into \"the new norm,\" which is anything but normal for them.",
    "aiResponse": "It can be difficult for children to adjust to changes in their family dynamic, such as a parent's new relationship. It is understandable that you want to move forward and create a happy and inclusive family with your boyfriend, but it is important to be patient and understanding of the challenges that your daughters may be facing.\n\nHere are a few things you can try to help your daughters adjust to your new relationship:\n\n1.  Talk to your daughters about their feelings: Encourage your daughters to express their thoughts and feelings about the changes in their family. Listen to their concerns and validate their emotions. It may be helpful to reassure them that it is okay to feel upset or confused about the changes and that you and your boyfriend are there to support them.\n\n2.  Set boundaries and establish routines: Children often feel more secure when they know what to expect. Establishing clear boundaries and routines can help your daughters feel more comfortable and give them a sense of stability.\n\n3.  Encourage open communication: Encourage open communication between all members of the family and make sure to include both daughters in family decisions and activities. This can help them feel like they are a valued part of the family.\n\n4.  Seek support: If your daughters are struggling to adjust to the changes in their family, it may be helpful to seek the support of a therapist or counselor. A professional can help your daughters work through their emotions and provide guidance on how to navigate the changes in their family.\n\nIt is important to be patient and understanding as your daughters adjust to the new dynamic in your family. It may take time, but with love and support, they will eventually learn to accept and embrace the new family structure."

    "concern": "My life is so messed up. I don't know what to do. A little more than a year ago, my husband decided he didn't trust me with HIS money, so he opened his own account. I told him he could pay the bills and keep track of the checking account, but he refused, saying he wanted his own.\n\nAbby, I have a good job. It's not the greatest, but it allows me to pay my bills. When I needed a new car, I got a second job to pay for it. I also needed money to smooth over the bad relationship between our daughter and her father. I gave her things I really couldn't afford, but felt I owed her something.\n\nOur daughter needed a car to get to work, but her father wouldn't agree to help her finance one. She asked me to co-sign on a loan, and I made the biggest mistake of my life when I agreed. A few weeks after she got the car, she lost her job. I didn't realize that the car payment was being automatically withdrawn from my account, but I don't always check my bank statement. I was horrified when I saw there was a big shortage -- she had not deposited enough money to cover the payment. She told me she had, but that was a lie. She also lied to me about money several times after that.\n\nI asked my husband for help with the account, but he refused and asked our daughter to move out. That meant she had to pay rent and utilities, so there was no way she could make up the back payments.\n\nAbby, I am so far behind on my bills I don't know what to do. I tried to get a loan to consolidate my bills, but I don't have sufficient collateral. I have canceled all my credit cards, but how do I live with so much debt taking every cent, leaving me no money to buy groceries or anything else? I'm desperate.",
    "abbyResponse": "Get thee to a credit counselor posthaste. The counselor can act as a buffer between you and your creditors to arrange more manageable payments than your current agreements specify. The counselor can also teach you to use credit wisely. Look in your telephone directory under the heading \"credit counselors.\"\n\nDamaged credit isn't the end of the world. If you regard this as a lesson in life, you'll get through it with your sanity intact. Just be patient and diligent about sticking to a budget.\n\nP.S. Insist that your daughter attend credit counseling with you.",
    "aiResponse": "I'm sorry to hear about the difficulties you're facing. It sounds like you're in a really tough situation and are feeling overwhelmed. It's understandable that you would feel this way, but it's important to remember that there are steps you can take to improve your financial situation.\n\nOne thing you could try is speaking with a credit counselor. A credit counselor can help you review your financial situation and provide guidance on how to manage your debt and improve your credit. They can also help you come up with a budget and develop a plan to pay off your debts. Credit counseling agencies are often non-profit organizations, and they can offer their services for free or at a low cost.\n\nYou might also consider reaching out to your creditors to see if they are willing to work with you to come up with a payment plan that works for both of you. In some cases, creditors are willing to lower interest rates or waive late fees if you are struggling to make your payments.\n\nIt's also a good idea to try to increase your income, if possible. This could mean taking on additional hours at work, getting a part-time job, or finding ways to earn extra money on the side.\n\nFinally, make sure to take care of yourself emotionally. It's important to find healthy ways to cope with stress, such as talking to a friend or family member, exercising, or finding a support group.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful to you. Remember, you are not alone, and there are resources available to help you get back on track."

    "concern": "We visit my grandmother out of state once a year. After our visits, I usually leave feeling defeated. A few reasons why:\n\nShe leaves multiple notes around \"reminding\" us to clean up after ourselves. There's a note in the shower that says, \"Please wipe down shower walls after use.\" She asks me to change the sheets or launder our towels before I leave. Although she has decorative paper hand towels in the bathrooms, she asks us not to use them because they are \"too expensive.\" She complains about my son's handprints on her windows (he's 2). She badmouths nearly everyone she knows, has unsolicited advice on everything and is generally highly judgmental.\n\nWhen we return home, she gushes about our visit for months, saying how \"lonely\" she is now that we're gone and how much she enjoyed our visit. I don't understand. Is this normal grandmother behavior, or does she take it too far? Must we continue spending big bucks to go out there every year, or can we just send pictures and call often?",
    "abbyResponse": "If these annual visits are a \"command performance,\" I can see why you might resent them. However, it's not unheard of for a hostess to leave a note asking that the shower be wiped down, or that the sheets and towels be laundered before a guest leaves -- particularly if the guests are family members. A gracious guest wouldn't mind doing those things, and would ask how her hostess wanted it handled before she left.\n\nRather than stew when she complained about your 2-year-old's handprints on her windows, the appropriate response would have been: \"You know, you're right. I'll get the Windex!\" And when she made a negative comment about someone, you should have found something nice to say about the person in response.\n\nIf these visits cause financial hardship, visit your grandmother every OTHER year, or consider inviting her to visit you, but don't cut her off completely. After all, she's family, and not all family members are \"perfect.\"",
    "aiResponse": "It's normal for grandparents to have different expectations and ways of doing things, and it's possible that your grandmother's behavior is simply a reflection of her personality and her way of maintaining her household. However, it sounds like her behavior is causing you a lot of stress and making your visits unpleasant.\n\nIt's important to remember that you have the right to set boundaries for yourself and to prioritize your own well-being. If spending time with your grandmother is causing you undue stress and frustration, it's okay to consider reducing the frequency of your visits or finding ways to make the visits more enjoyable for yourself.\n\nOne option you could consider is having a candid conversation with your grandmother to express your feelings and to try to find a way to make the visits more enjoyable for both of you. It may be helpful to emphasize that you value your relationship with her and want to find a way to make your visits more enjoyable for both of you. You could also suggest specific changes that you think would make the visits more enjoyable, such as agreeing to a list of housekeeping expectations or finding activities that you both enjoy.\n\nIt's also important to remember that it's okay to take breaks from relationships that are causing you stress or are not healthy for you. If you decide that it's best to reduce the frequency of your visits or to communicate with your grandmother in other ways, such as through phone calls or video chats, that is a perfectly valid choice.\n\nI hope this advice is helpful. Remember to prioritize your own well-being and to communicate openly and honestly with your grandmother."

    "abbyResponse": "The most important thing you can do is stop feeling guilty for enjoying yourself. I can think of nothing that would make your mother happier than to know you are living your life to the fullest and exercising your potential.\n\nTalk to a counselor at school about how to get your grade level back where it should be.

Our struggles are vigorous, but never violent, and always end with a kiss or more.\n\nMy friends are horrified. They say I could be injured and that any man who would physically \"fight\" a woman is a potential wife-beater or worse.\n\nSo many people have warned me to \"watch out\" that now I'm beginning to wonder. To me, it's a good way to have fun and burn off calories. What's your take on this, Abby?",
    "abbyResponse": "If you are the one initiating these \"fights,\" then I doubt that your boyfriend is a potential wife-beater or worse. (If it were the other way around, I might be concerned.) What you have described sounds more like foreplay than abuse. As long as you both enjoy it and no one becomes injured, what the two of you do is nobody's business, so keep it private.",
    "aiResponse": "It's important to remember that physical activity, including wrestling, can be a fun and healthy way to bond with your partner and burn calories. However, it's also important to make sure that both partners are comfortable with the activity and that it is conducted in a safe and consensual manner. It's not okay for one partner to use physical force or aggression in a way that could cause harm or make the other partner feel uncomfortable or unsafe.\n\nIt's also important to be mindful of the potential for injury when engaging in physical activity, and to take steps to minimize the risk of injury. This might include wearing protective gear, following proper safety guidelines, and stopping the activity if anyone is injured or if it stops being enjoyable for either partner.\n\nFinally, it's not appropriate for anyone to make assumptions about someone's character based on their hobbies or interests. It's not fair to label someone as a potential abuser simply because they enjoy physical activity with their partner. It's important to remember that healthy relationships are built on trust, respect, and communication, and that it's never okay for one partner to use physical force or aggression in a harmful or abusive way."

Recently my oldest sister, \"Eva,\" moved back to this area and says she intends to plant a yellow rose bush on Mom's grave, because yellow roses were her favorite flower.\n\nI don't think live roses are appropriate on a grave, so I asked the cemetery attendant about it. He told me no one had ever made such a request, but he was unaware of any policy about planting flowers on graves. He's a friend of the family, so I'm sure he won't tell Eva that she can't plant a rose bush. He did comment that the bush would have to be kept pruned so that it wouldn't interfere with mowing.\n\nAbby, would I be out of line to ask my sister not to follow through on her plan? The grave is near the center of our family plot, and I think the bush would be out of place. And who would be responsible for the care of the roses? I have taken pride in how Mother's grave has looked all these years, but I don't want to take care of a live plant.

It's also important to note that It's not only your graduation, its a milestone for your family too and they may want to share this achievement with other members of the family.\n\nAs for the party, you are not obliged to invite everyone to the party, you can select specific people you want to invite, like your close friends, mentors, and family members who you want to share this celebration with.\n\n2.  Tracking gifts:\n\nIt's important to keep track of the gifts you receive at your graduation party, so that you can properly thank the gift-givers. There are a few ways to do this:\n\n-- Keep a log of the gifts: You can use a notebook or a spreadsheet to keep track of the gift and the giver.\n\n-- Take photos of the gifts: This can help you remember what you received and from whom, if you are having trouble keeping track.\n\n-- Ask people to include a card: If you're expecting a lot of gifts, you can ask people to include a card with their gift so that you can easily match the gift to the giver.\n\nIt's also important to note that, regardless of the method you choose to track the gifts, it is good practice to send Thank you notes to each gift giver. This will show your appreciation for their thoughtfulness and will help maintain your relationship with them in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, it's important to be respectful of your grandmother's wishes when it comes to inviting family members to your graduation celebration, and to keep track of the gifts you receive so that you can properly thank the gift-givers."

I dated him anyway because I was immature, depressed and lonely.\n\nSince we broke up and I got my mental health back on track, my life has been wonderful. I keep moving up and forward in life. I hear through the grapevine that his life, on the other hand, is in shambles.\n\nI blame myself for wasting the time I did with him. Sometimes when he pops into my head I get sick to my stomach. I'm afraid he might come back into my life and harm me because he blames me for his miserable life and bad choices.\n\nHow do you remove such a negative person from your memory? Is it possible to forget -- especially when you want to?",
    "abbyResponse": "Your experiences have made you the person you are, and at this point in your life, you have made yourself successful and happy. Congratulations for that. Now it's time to stop listening to news about your ex-boyfriend through the grapevine.\n\nWhen friends bring him up, tell them you aren't interested. If he lives nearby, frequents the same places you do and has threatened you, talk to law enforcement or move. Give it time; time has a way of healing. It's important that you continue getting on with your life. You may find fears will dissipate once you find a new significant other.",
    "aiResponse": "It's normal to have feelings of guilt or regret after a relationship, especially one that was not healthy or positive. It's important to remember that you were in a different place in your life when you dated this person, and you made the best choices you could at the time. It's also important to remember that you are not responsible for someone else's choices or life circumstances.\n\nIt's understandable that you might be worried about this person coming back into your life and causing harm, but it's important to remember that you have control over your own safety and well-being. If you have any concerns, it's a good idea to speak to a trusted friend, family member, or therapist about them.\n\nAs for removing negative person from your memory, it's not always easy or possible to completely forget someone, but there are things you can do to help distance yourself from negative thoughts and memories:\n\n-- Practice mindfulness: focus on the present moment, rather than dwelling on past experiences.\n\n-- Keep yourself busy: engage in activities that you enjoy, whether it be sports, hobbies or volunteer work.\n\n-- Focus on self-care: make sure you're taking care of yourself physically and emotionally.\n\n-- Talk to someone: consider speaking to a therapist or counselor to work through your feelings and develop coping strategies.\n\n-- Don't suppress your feelings: try not to suppress or ignore your feelings about this person, it's important to acknowledge and process them.\n\nAlso, it's good to remind yourself that, the time you spent with this person was a learning experience and it helped you grow and change as a person. You now have a better understanding of what kind of person you want in your life and what you don't want. Remember, you deserve to be surrounded by people who bring out the best in you and make you feel good about yourself.\n\nIt's also important to remember that the passage of time can help fade memories and the intensity of feelings, and that it's okay to give yourself time to heal and move forward."

For the last four years, they have never once booked ground transportation from home to the airport and back. Instead, they rely on friends to take them to the airport.\n\nThey have plenty of money. They are just too cheap to pay for a shuttle, cab or limo. They never offer to put gas in the car or pay for the parking. It is a 45-minute drive in heavy traffic.\n\nThey are getting ready for another trip. What should I say when asked? Please give me your thoughts on their behavior.",
    "abbyResponse": "These friends appear to be centered on themselves. Rather than fume about it, the next time you are asked to drive them to the airport, tell them you have a conflict and are unavailable.",
    "aiResponse": "It can be frustrating when friends take advantage of one's kindness and generosity. In this case, it sounds like your friends are expecting you to provide transportation to and from the airport without any form of reimbursement or compensation. This kind of behavior can be considered as taking advantage and being inconsiderate of other people's time and resources.\n\nIt's important to set boundaries and communicate your feelings clearly and assertively. You have every right to say no when asked to provide transportation, or to ask for reimbursement for gas and parking. Here are a few things you might say when they ask for a ride:\n\n-- \"I'd be happy to take you to the airport, but I'll need to be reimbursed for gas and parking.\"\n\n-- \"I won't be able to take you to the airport this time, but you can look into other transportation options like a shuttle, taxi or ride-sharing service.\"\n\n-- \"I understand that you're looking for a ride to the airport, but I can't offer that this time as it causes inconvenience for me as well.\"\n\nIt's also important to remember that you are not obligated to provide transportation for your friends and you should not feel guilty for setting boundaries and taking care of your own needs. If your friends continue to ask you for rides and don't compensate you, it might be worth re-evaluating the dynamics of your friendship. They may not value the friendship as much as you do and it's worth to rethink about continuing this kind of friendship which is not respectful of your time and resources.\n\nIt's always good to have a direct and honest conversation with friends about the behavior and feelings, this will help you understand the situation better and reach a solution that is fair and comfortable for everyone."

Our children are stressed, anxious and depressed. We have never indulged them with a lot of video game or TV time. I have considered pulling my kids out of this school, but the public schools around here are awful.\n\nParents are miserable. Kids are miserable. We want them to have a decent education, but we also want them to be happy people -- and right now, no one is happy.",
    "abbyResponse": "Are you aware that some educators feel that students should have no summer vacation at all, and should be in class year-round? The assignments your children were given may have been designed to keep their skills sharp so they would be prepared for the fall term. Because you and other parents feel your children are being overburdened with busywork, it's time to address this as a group with the principal so you can voice your concerns and get an explanation.",
    "aiResponse": "It sounds like the current situation at your children's school is not sustainable, as it is causing stress, anxiety, and depression for both your children and yourself as parents. It's important to remember that education is not just about academic achievement, but also about fostering social and emotional well-being. A heavy workload and an emphasis on grades and test scores can contribute to feelings of stress and pressure, which can negatively impact children's mental health.\n\nIt may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with the school administration, teachers and other parents, to express your concerns and see if there are ways to make changes that would benefit everyone. An appropriate workload should be challenging, yet still reasonable for the students of that grade level. If the school is unresponsive to your concerns, it may be necessary to consider other educational options, such as homeschooling, online classes or alternative schools, in order to prioritize the well-being of your children."

We had a fine time reconnecting, although my wife commented after they left that they seemed to have \"slowed down a bit\" -- to which I responded, \"Yeah. Us, too, I guess.\"\n\nWe just received an email from that couple's adult daughter, with whom we're also friendly, asking about our perceptions of her parents' well-being. We are not comfortable responding to her very pointed questions about their eating habits, bedtimes, taking of medications, mental sharpness, etc. while they stayed with us. Is this kind of inquiry common today, or do these folks have \"helicopter kids\"?",
    "abbyResponse": "If it's common, I'm unaware of it. It's the first question of this kind that I have received. Clearly, the daughter has noticed something going on with her parents that has her worried. Because \"the kids\" are so concerned about their parents' welfare that they feel compelled to ask these kinds of questions, perhaps they should travel with them so they can supervise.\n\nIf you choose to answer that email, an appropriate response would be, \"I think we have all slowed down a little, but if you want to know what your folks ate (etc.) while they were with us, you should ask them.\"",
    "aiResponse": "It is becoming more common for adult children to take a more active role in monitoring the well-being of their aging parents, including their physical and mental health. This is sometimes referred to as \"helicopter parenting\" in reference to the way the parent is hovering over their child.

Both brothers pretty much ignored me, except for calls on my birthday that were filled with awkward silence because we didn't know each other well enough to talk about anything.

My husband, \"Fred,\" goes to help and entertain her every weekend, and I sometimes accompany him. She has enough money to stay in an assisted living facility, but Fred wants to build a mother-in-law apartment for her on our property.\n\nAbby, I don't like her. She was a bully when she was younger, and she's still manipulative. She has made some comments about me hitting her, which never happened. Of course, Fred believed me. If she lives with us, I will be her main caregiver because I have a home-based business and a flexible schedule.\n\nI have already said no to Fred's idea, but I don't want to be the bad guy. His two brothers live states away and don't want to be involved because of the way their mother treated them during their teens. Fred is the only son willing to overlook past issues and has made peace with her.\n\nCould you help me to sort this out?",
    "abbyResponse": "I'll try. Caring for someone who has Alzheimer's disease is a full-time job because the disease is progressive. While Fred's mother can live alone with the help of a professional once a week now, that will soon not be the case. She will become increasingly helpless and so confused that should an emergency arise in her apartment she will be unable to think sequentially enough to know what to do. She may no longer recognize who you are and become agitated and combative.\n\nFor these reasons your mother-in-law should be in an assisted living facility staffed with caregivers who have been trained to take care of people with Alzheimer's. Because you have a business to run, it can't be you. Since Fred has made peace with his mother, he should visit her often to ensure she is well-treated. But he should not expect the responsibility of caring for her to be yours because it is unrealistic.",
    "aiResponse": "It is understandable that you would have concerns about having your mother-in-law live with you, especially given her past behavior and the fact that she is in the early stages of Alzheimer's. It's important to have open and honest communication with your husband about your feelings and concerns.\n\nYou can express to him that you understand his desire to take care of his mother, but that you also have your own needs and boundaries that need to be considered. You can explain that you do not feel comfortable being her primary caregiver, given the history and the current situation, and that you are worried about the impact this would have on your own well-being\n\nIt's important to find a solution that is best for everyone. You can explore other options with your husband such as assisted living or hiring a live-in caregiver. It's also important to consider that it may be difficult for Fred to find a solution that both you and him are happy with, but it's important that you also maintain your own mental and emotional well-being.\n\nYou can also remind Fred that it's not fair for you to bear the responsibility alone, and that it's important for him to take on more responsibilities and help you with the care of his mother. Ultimately, it's important that you and your husband come to a decision that you both feel comfortable with, and that takes into account the needs and well-being of everyone involved."

He also has a couple of drinks, upgrades his salad and orders dessert. By the time he's done, the cost of his meal is double that of everyone else's.\n\nAlthough we can afford it, we feel this is bad manners. I'm not sure if he's trying to take advantage of us or if he just thinks he is entitled. Our daughter thinks he's wonderful and doesn't seem to mind that he does this.

    "abbyResponse": "If you bring the subject up, I can almost guarantee that what you say will not be well received. What your son-in-law is doing is \"acceptable\" in light of the fact that you say you can afford it. If you couldn't, I assume those dinner invitations would be few and far between, and you would have had to explain the reason to your daughter. When they dine out with contemporaries, presumably the bill is split between the couples. If that isn't the case, it probably wouldn't happen twice because the other couple would likely request separate checks.",
    "aiResponse": "It's understandable that you would be bothered by this behavior, especially if it makes you feel taken advantage of or if you think it reflects poorly on your daughter. However, it's important to remember that Brody is your son-in-law and you want to maintain a good relationship with him and your daughter.\n\nIt might be helpful to have a conversation with your daughter and express your concerns. Let her know how you feel and ask her how she feels about the situation. If she is not bothered by it, it might be best to accept it and not say anything further. However, if she is also concerned, then you could work together to come up with a way to bring it up to Brody in a gentle and non-confrontational way.\n\nAlternatively, one way to address this would be to have a casual, non-confrontational conversation with Brody. You could express your concerns in a friendly way, and let him know that you understand that everyone has different tastes and budgets. And, you could suggest that next time they could choose a more casual or less expensive place to dine, or could split the check.\n\nIt is ultimately up to you and your husband how to handle this situation but it's important that you keep your relationship with your daughter and son-in-law in mind."

It's natural to want to have things that others have, especially when you're in school and want to fit in.\n\nHowever, it's important to remember that material possessions are not the most important thing in life. Your birthday should be a celebration of you, and not just about getting presents.

    "concern": "My wife and I have been married 20 years and have three children, ages 10 to 17. Our oldest is a senior in high school. Her best friend, \"Maya,\" is a friend of the family we have known for 10 years. Maya's parents have been divorced for as long as we've known her. She lives with her single mom. Her dad moved out of state.\n\nMaya spends a lot of time with us on weekends, and we have all embraced her as another family member. Recently, Maya pulled me aside and asked if I could be a father figure in her life. I was honored and immediately agreed. Now when she comes over she calls me \"Dad\" and even says \"I love you.\" I say it back.\n\nLast week, my wife mentioned that our younger two children have noticed the bond between me and Maya and are upset about it. How can I be there for Maya through these tough teen years without alienating my own younger kids?",
    "abbyResponse": "Consider having a talk with your younger children and explaining to them that the more love there is in this world, the better our world will be. Explain that Maya has no father in her life, and that any affection you express for her does not lessen the love you feel for them, and they will always be \"No. 1\" in your heart.\n\nThis does not, however, mean that you cannot have love for Maya, too, and say it when you think she needs to hear it. If you haven't already been doing it, make special time for your younger children that does not include Maya. If you do, perhaps it will help them to feel less threatened.",
    "aiResponse": "It is important to have open and honest conversations with your wife and children about your role in Maya's life. Explain to them that while you care for and love Maya as if she were your own child, she is not replacing any of them. Emphasize that you have enough love and time to go around for all of them. It may also be helpful to establish clear boundaries and make sure that your attention is distributed evenly among all your children. Encourage your younger children to spend time with Maya and include her in family activities. Consider involving a therapist or counselor to help everyone navigate this new dynamic in the family. Ultimately, it's important to remember that your role as a father is to support and guide all your children, including Maya, through their teenage years."

    "concern": "I'm a 12-year-old girl who loves music and electronics. I sit on the swing and listen to music on my iPod through my earbuds. I do it at least a half-hour every day -- sometimes more.\n\nWhen my grandma visited a few weeks ago, she tried to talk to me when I was giving my iPod my undivided attention. When I finally realized she was talking to me, I took my earbuds out so I could hear her. She told me the earbuds were going to make me deaf. (I listen on four or five notches.)\n\nOne night we were playing a card game where you have to play really fast and watch a gazillion piles of cards at once. The game made me dizzy, and I said so at the end of the round. Grandma said it was because of my iPod. It was all I could do to say politely, \"No, it's not.\"\n\nIs there a way to tell her to stop blaming my iPod for everything? I consider my iPod a friend.",
    "abbyResponse": "Loud noises can damage a person's hearing, and there is legitimate concern that the sound levels at which people listen to music cause hearing problems.\n\nHowever, I suspect your grandmother is less concerned with the damage your iPod will do \"on four or five notches\" than she is about the fact that you don't give her your full attention when you're spending time together. I'm surprised your parents haven't mentioned to you that showing good manners means being polite, respectful and not ignoring your grandmother when she's trying to talk to you or play a game with you.",
    "aiResponse": "It can be difficult when someone we care about expresses concerns that we don't agree with, but it's important to remember that your grandma is likely coming from a place of love and concern for your well-being.\n\nOne way to address her concerns is to have a calm and open conversation with her. You can express that you understand her concerns, but you have done your own research and have taken necessary precautions to ensure that your listening habits are safe. You can also let her know that you enjoy listening to music on your iPod and that it brings you a lot of joy.\n\nIt might also be helpful to show her some resources, such as the World Health Organization's guidelines for safe listening, so she can see that listening to music at moderate levels is safe.\n\nAdditionally, you can remind her that the dizziness you felt during the card game was not caused by your iPod, but by the fast-paced nature of the game. It's important to be honest and clear about the real cause of the dizziness.\n\nIt's also important to remember that you have the right to make your own choices about how you use your iPod, but it's also important to consider other's feelings and concerns. It is possible to have a compromise and find a middle ground with her."

    "concern": "It is easy to watch or read the news and think people are awful and this world is going nowhere fast. At New Year's I made a resolution to try and do something about how I view society. I decided I'd do 30 random acts of service for strangers.\n\nI know it may seem small and insignificant, but at least I can say I'm trying to make this a better place to live. I'm hoping it will spread a message of love and caring in a world with too much hurt and violence. Ideally, one or two people will notice and pay it forward.\n\nIt's spring, and so far I have volunteered as a math tutor at a local school and shoveled the snow off a neighbor's sidewalk. But I'm already falling behind, and I'm struggling to come up with some good ideas. I know you and your readers often have creative suggestions. Can you suggest more acts of service I can do for strangers?",
    "abbyResponse": "You could volunteer at a local food pantry. Or find an organization that delivers food to shut-ins and take meals to the clients they serve a couple of days a month.\n\nYou could bring a garbage bag with you when you take walks in the morning or evening and pick up paper cups, plastic bags, cigarette butts and candy wrappers that litter our streets and beaches. Or simply acknowledge the presence of others by smiling and saying, \"good morning,\" \"good afternoon\" and \"good evening\" to people you encounter.",
    "aiResponse": "Here are a few ideas for acts of service you can do for strangers:\n\n1.  Leave a kind note or small gift for a cashier, delivery person, or other service worker to brighten their day.\n2.  Pick up trash in a park or other public space.\n3.  Leave a book or magazine in a waiting room or public transportation for someone to enjoy.\n4.  Offer to help an older person with their groceries or other errands.\n5.  Cook a meal for a local shelter or food bank.\n6.  Donate blood.\n7.  Pay for the person's order behind you in a drive-thru or coffee shop.\n8.  Offer to walk a neighbor's dog or pet-sit for someone in need.\n9.  Leave a bag of non-perishable food items in a public place for someone in need to find.\n10.  Offer to run an errand for someone who is sick or unable to leave their home.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to do these acts of service from a place of kindness and generosity, rather than trying to get recognition or reward. And also you can customize these to your local community and context."

    "concern": "For the two years I've been married to \"John,\" I have known his parents wished he had married someone other than me. They have never accepted me or tried to get to know me as a daughter-in-law. Family is important to me. All I ever hoped was that they'd give me half a chance.\n\nI've told John how I feel. He has yet to stand up for me. What upsets me is his mom and dad are nice to my face and in John's presence, but when he isn't around they ignore me. It's like I'm invisible.\n\nMy husband is in the military. During the past year he has been away on active duty, his parents have never once invited me to spend a holiday or any other time with them. I am always the one to reach out. John is due home next month, and I know my in-laws will try to \"make nice\" with me for his benefit -- but it's all fake.\n\nIf they truly wanted to get to know me, they would have tried while I was alone. (I live less than a mile from them.) I am sad, hurt and angry about the way I've been treated in my husband's absence. I love him more than anything, but my biggest fear is that when we're reunited, my feelings toward his folks will have a spillover effect on our marriage. What can be done, Abby?",
    "abbyResponse": "When your husband returns, impress upon him the fact that his parents never called or invited you to join them in his absence. It's a shame to have to put him in the middle, but these are his parents and if they'll listen to anybody, it's most likely him.\n\nIn the meantime, develop other emotional resources with other military families. When a loved one goes on active duty, it's not unusual that those left behind are on an emotional roller-coaster. Other wives (and husbands) can appreciate how you feel. Perhaps you can support each other.",
    "aiResponse": "It is understandable that you feel hurt and upset by the way your in-laws have treated you. It can be difficult when family members do not accept or make an effort to get to know you. It's important to remember that your relationship with your in-laws is separate from your relationship with your husband.\n\nIt may be helpful to have a conversation with your husband about how you feel and express your concerns about how this situation may affect your relationship with him. It's important for him to understand your feelings and for you to have his support.\n\nYou can also consider setting boundaries with your in-laws. It's okay to let them know that you are hurt by their behavior and that you expect to be treated with respect and kindness. You may also want to limit the time you spend with them if their behavior continues to be hurtful.\n\nIt may also be helpful to seek support from a therapist or counselor who can help you process your feelings and navigate this difficult situation.\n\nIt's important to take care of yourself and prioritize your own well-being. Remember, you deserve to be treated with respect and kindness, and it's important to advocate for yourself and your needs."

    "concern": "I seem to be having a communication problem.\n\nI became a widow a year ago. I have two sons, a daughter and three grandsons. They are very good to me. They take me out to dinner often and will buy me anything I say I need.\n\nHowever, what I really need is help around the house -- someone to mow my lawn, trim the shrubs and trees, paint, etc. I can't do these things myself. I am 72 years old, and having to pay for this kind of help doesn't leave much for extras.\n\nIt's a shame, Abby. Here I am with two sons, a son-in-law and three grandsons -- and no help. Please don't use my name. I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings. I just want to be heard.",
    "abbyResponse": "Here's your letter. You should be more specific about your needs. Offer to prepare lunch in exchange for a day of work around your home, then be effusive with your appreciation. Here's hoping that after this runs, you (and others who are in the same boat) won't have to send out a cry for help.",
    "aiResponse": "It can be difficult to communicate your needs, especially when it comes to asking for help from family members. It may be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your sons and son-in-law about your needs and how they can support you. It's also important to consider that they may not be aware of your struggles or that their actions may not be meeting your needs. You could express your gratitude for their support, but also express your need for help with specific tasks around the house. Remember to frame it as a request, not a demand. It's also possible that they may not have the skills or time to help with certain tasks, and in that case, hiring professionals or looking into community resources may be a good option."
