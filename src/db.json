    "concern": "I have been concerned about my parents for some time now. They are elderly and live in a retirement community. They have a very nice home and don't have to worry about money.\n\nThe problem is, they drink every day -- sometimes from noon to when they go to bed. Many times, their drinking has caused arguments and police visits. When I express my concern about their drinking, they tell me to stay out of it, mind my own business, and they're retired and have earned the right to do whatever they want.\n\nI don't mind them having cocktails every now and then, but this has gotten out of hand. I think they have become alcoholics and only bad things are coming of it. They refuse to listen to me, or anybody else, for that matter. What should I do?",
    "abbyResponse": "As people age, their bodies are sometimes less able to metabolize alcohol than they were when they were younger. When things get out of hand to the extent that the police are being called, I agree something must be done. Because there is this level of disruption going on, it follows that the neighbors in that very nice retirement community must be less than thrilled.,\n\nThat your parents drink is only part of the problem. Elderly people can suffer from balance problems even when they are sober. It is common for someone who is inebriated to fall, which could cause your mom or dad to suffer serious injury.,\n\nIf other family members are also worried about your folks, an intervention might be in order. Before attempting one, attend some Al-Anon meetings so you can listen to others' similar experiences and learn how they were handled. Visit www.al-anon.alateen.org, or call 1-888-4-ALANON to find a meeting near you.",
    "aiResponse": "It sounds like you are in a very difficult situation and are concerned about your parents' well-being. It can be frustrating and heartbreaking when loved ones refuse to listen to our concerns or make changes that we believe are necessary for their health and safety.\n\nThere are a few things you can try in this situation:\n\n1. Seek support for yourself: It can be emotionally draining to try to help someone who is not ready to accept help. Make sure to take care of yourself and seek support from friends, family, or a professional therapist to help you cope with the stress and frustration you are feeling.\n\n2. Gather information and resources: Learn more about alcoholism and how to approach the subject with your parents. There are many resources available, such as the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (NCADD) and Al-Anon, a support group for family and friends of alcoholics.\n\n3. Have a calm and non-confrontational conversation with your parents: It may be helpful to have a conversation with your parents about your concerns in a calm and non-judgmental way. Avoid lecturing or criticizing them, and instead focus on expressing your love and concern for them. Let them know that you are available to support them if they decide they want to make a change.\n\n4. Consider staging an intervention: If your efforts to communicate with your parents have not been successful, you may want to consider staging an intervention with the help of a professional interventionist. An intervention is a structured process in which a person's friends and family confront the person about their problem behavior and offer support and assistance in seeking treatment.\n\nIt's important to remember that ultimately, the decision to change their behavior is up to your parents. You can offer support and encouragement, but you cannot force them to make a change."

    "concern": "My daughter says her children, ages 11 and 8, are afraid of me because I correct their lack of manners. Is asking them to say \"please\" and \"thank you,\" or to use a knife to cut things on their plate into small pieces rather than have food hanging out of their mouths, really expecting too much?\n\nIf their parents don't care, who will teach them? While I no longer expect people to keep their arms off the table, what are the minimal standards I should expect at a dinner table these days? Or am I expected to watch slobs sprawled over the table, picking at their food with their hands and chewing with their mouths open?",
    "abbyResponse": "Sometimes it isn't what we say, as much as how we say it. I see nothing wrong with reminding children to use their manners and explaining what they are. But if you are doing it in such a way that your grandchildren are afraid of you, it may be time to work on your delivery.",
    "aiResponse": "It is not unreasonable to expect children to have basic table manners, such as using utensils and saying \"please\" and \"thank you.\" These are important social skills that help children interact with others in a respectful and polite way. It is understandable that you want to teach your grandchildren good manners and that you may feel frustrated if they are not using them.\n\nThat being said, it is important to remember that children, especially young ones, may not always remember to use good manners, especially if they are not used to being corrected or if they have not had much practice using them. It is important to be patient and to remember that children learn through repetition and positive reinforcement.\n\nOne way to teach good table manners is to model the behavior you want to see. When you are at the dinner table, use good manners yourself and make a point to thank others for passing the food or for cooking the meal. You can also give your grandchildren gentle reminders to use good manners, such as saying \"Remember to say 'please' when you ask for something.\"\n\nIt is also important to remember that children may be afraid of you if you are consistently correcting their behavior or if you are overly critical. It may be helpful to try to find a balance between setting expectations for behavior and being understanding and patient with your grandchildren as they learn and grow."

He is also divorced, with a 13-year-old daughter.\n\nWe have tried to be sensitive and understanding about their feelings about our recent divorces and our relationship, but both girls are having a difficult time coping with it. We are very loving and inclusive, so it's not as if they should feel resentful or left out. But this is starting to cause a rift in our relationship.\n\nThere comes a point when they need to understand that this is the new norm and get used to it. We try to include each other's daughter in shared events, but it ends up becoming a forced struggle. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
    "abbyResponse": "Welcome to the world of blended families. As much as we would wish it, the adjustment isn't always smooth, because when children are involved, their world is often torn apart.\n\nA resource that can be helpful would be the Stepfamily Foundation Inc. (stepfamily.org). Your former spouses can also ease the adjustment for the girls by remaining actively involved in their lives, curbing their hostility and not pitting the children against either of you.\n\nHowever, if that's not in the cards, then enlist the help of a licensed family therapist. Blended family counseling, divorce and remarriage counseling may be necessary to ease the girls' transition into \"the new norm,\" which is anything but normal for them.",
    "aiResponse": "It can be difficult for children to adjust to changes in their family dynamic, such as a parent's new relationship. It is understandable that you want to move forward and create a happy and inclusive family with your boyfriend, but it is important to be patient and understanding of the challenges that your daughters may be facing.\n\nHere are a few things you can try to help your daughters adjust to your new relationship:\n\n1. Talk to your daughters about their feelings: Encourage your daughters to express their thoughts and feelings about the changes in their family. Listen to their concerns and validate their emotions. It may be helpful to reassure them that it is okay to feel upset or confused about the changes and that you and your boyfriend are there to support them.\n\n2. Set boundaries and establish routines: Children often feel more secure when they know what to expect. Establishing clear boundaries and routines can help your daughters feel more comfortable and give them a sense of stability.\n\n3. Encourage open communication: Encourage open communication between all members of the family and make sure to include both daughters in family decisions and activities. This can help them feel like they are a valued part of the family.\n\n4. Seek support: If your daughters are struggling to adjust to the changes in their family, it may be helpful to seek the support of a therapist or counselor. A professional can help your daughters work through their emotions and provide guidance on how to navigate the changes in their family.\n\nIt is important to be patient and understanding as your daughters adjust to the new dynamic in your family. It may take time, but with love and support, they will eventually learn to accept and embrace the new family structure."

    "concern": "My life is so messed up. I don't know what to do. A little more than a year ago, my husband decided he didn't trust me with HIS money, so he opened his own account. I told him he could pay the bills and keep track of the checking account, but he refused, saying he wanted his own.\n\nAbby, I have a good job. It's not the greatest, but it allows me to pay my bills. When I needed a new car, I got a second job to pay for it. I also needed money to smooth over the bad relationship between our daughter and her father. I gave her things I really couldn't afford, but felt I owed her something.\n\nOur daughter needed a car to get to work, but her father wouldn't agree to help her finance one. She asked me to co-sign on a loan, and I made the biggest mistake of my life when I agreed. A few weeks after she got the car, she lost her job. I didn't realize that the car payment was being automatically withdrawn from my account, but I don't always check my bank statement. I was horrified when I saw there was a big shortage -- she had not deposited enough money to cover the payment. She told me she had, but that was a lie. She also lied to me about money several times after that.\n\nI asked my husband for help with the account, but he refused and asked our daughter to move out. That meant she had to pay rent and utilities, so there was no way she could make up the back payments.\n\nAbby, I am so far behind on my bills I don't know what to do. I tried to get a loan to consolidate my bills, but I don't have sufficient collateral. I have canceled all my credit cards, but how do I live with so much debt taking every cent, leaving me no money to buy groceries or anything else? I'm desperate.",
    "abbyResponse": "Get thee to a credit counselor posthaste. The counselor can act as a buffer between you and your creditors to arrange more manageable payments than your current agreements specify. The counselor can also teach you to use credit wisely. Look in your telephone directory under the heading \"credit counselors.\"\n\nDamaged credit isn't the end of the world. If you regard this as a lesson in life, you'll get through it with your sanity intact. Just be patient and diligent about sticking to a budget.\n\nP.S. Insist that your daughter attend credit counseling with you.",
    "aiResponse": "I'm sorry to hear about the difficulties you're facing. It sounds like you're in a really tough situation and are feeling overwhelmed. It's understandable that you would feel this way, but it's important to remember that there are steps you can take to improve your financial situation.\n\nOne thing you could try is speaking with a credit counselor. A credit counselor can help you review your financial situation and provide guidance on how to manage your debt and improve your credit. They can also help you come up with a budget and develop a plan to pay off your debts. Credit counseling agencies are often non-profit organizations, and they can offer their services for free or at a low cost.\n\nYou might also consider reaching out to your creditors to see if they are willing to work with you to come up with a payment plan that works for both of you. In some cases, creditors are willing to lower interest rates or waive late fees if you are struggling to make your payments.\n\nIt's also a good idea to try to increase your income, if possible. This could mean taking on additional hours at work, getting a part-time job, or finding ways to earn extra money on the side.\n\nFinally, make sure to take care of yourself emotionally. It's important to find healthy ways to cope with stress, such as talking to a friend or family member, exercising, or finding a support group.\n\nI hope these suggestions are helpful to you. Remember, you are not alone, and there are resources available to help you get back on track."

    "concern": "We visit my grandmother out of state once a year. After our visits, I usually leave feeling defeated. A few reasons why:\n\nShe leaves multiple notes around \"reminding\" us to clean up after ourselves. There's a note in the shower that says, \"Please wipe down shower walls after use.\" She asks me to change the sheets or launder our towels before I leave. Although she has decorative paper hand towels in the bathrooms, she asks us not to use them because they are \"too expensive.\" She complains about my son's handprints on her windows (he's 2). She badmouths nearly everyone she knows, has unsolicited advice on everything and is generally highly judgmental.\n\nWhen we return home, she gushes about our visit for months, saying how \"lonely\" she is now that we're gone and how much she enjoyed our visit. I don't understand. Is this normal grandmother behavior, or does she take it too far? Must we continue spending big bucks to go out there every year, or can we just send pictures and call often?",
    "abbyResponse": "If these annual visits are a \"command performance,\" I can see why you might resent them. However, it's not unheard of for a hostess to leave a note asking that the shower be wiped down, or that the sheets and towels be laundered before a guest leaves -- particularly if the guests are family members. A gracious guest wouldn't mind doing those things, and would ask how her hostess wanted it handled before she left.\n\nRather than stew when she complained about your 2-year-old's handprints on her windows, the appropriate response would have been: \"You know, you're right. I'll get the Windex!\" And when she made a negative comment about someone, you should have found something nice to say about the person in response.\n\nIf these visits cause financial hardship, visit your grandmother every OTHER year, or consider inviting her to visit you, but don't cut her off completely. After all, she's family, and not all family members are \"perfect.\"",
    "aiResponse": "It's normal for grandparents to have different expectations and ways of doing things, and it's possible that your grandmother's behavior is simply a reflection of her personality and her way of maintaining her household. However, it sounds like her behavior is causing you a lot of stress and making your visits unpleasant.\n\nIt's important to remember that you have the right to set boundaries for yourself and to prioritize your own well-being. If spending time with your grandmother is causing you undue stress and frustration, it's okay to consider reducing the frequency of your visits or finding ways to make the visits more enjoyable for yourself.\n\nOne option you could consider is having a candid conversation with your grandmother to express your feelings and to try to find a way to make the visits more enjoyable for both of you. It may be helpful to emphasize that you value your relationship with her and want to find a way to make your visits more enjoyable for both of you. You could also suggest specific changes that you think would make the visits more enjoyable, such as agreeing to a list of housekeeping expectations or finding activities that you both enjoy.\n\nIt's also important to remember that it's okay to take breaks from relationships that are causing you stress or are not healthy for you. If you decide that it's best to reduce the frequency of your visits or to communicate with your grandmother in other ways, such as through phone calls or video chats, that is a perfectly valid choice.\n\nI hope this advice is helpful. Remember to prioritize your own well-being and to communicate openly and honestly with your grandmother."

My grades aren't good, and I keep getting myself into hot water. My mother has a lot of health problems, so she doesn't need my problems on top of hers. I keep asking myself why this is happening to us.\n\nMother told me she wants me to live a life that will make me happy, and not let her poor health ruin my teen years. Is it wrong for me to enjoy these years and plan what I want to do with my future even though my mother is very sick? What can I do to get my life back on the right track?",
    "abbyResponse": "The most important thing you can do is stop feeling guilty for enjoying yourself. I can think of nothing that would make your mother happier than to know you are living your life to the fullest and exercising your potential.\n\nTalk to a counselor at school about how to get your grade level back where it should be. If you are in with the wrong crowd, involve yourself in activities where you will make constructive and rewarding friendships. And most of all, share your victories with your mother.

It's important to remember that you are not alone, and there are resources available to help you get back on track.\n\nFirst, it's important to focus on taking care of yourself and your own well-being. This means making sure you are getting enough sleep, eating healthy, and finding healthy ways to cope with stress, such as talking to a trusted adult, participating in physical activity or hobbies that you enjoy, or finding a support group.\n\nIt's also a good idea to reach out to someone you trust, such as a teacher, counselor, or family member, and talk about how you are feeling.

Our struggles are vigorous, but never violent, and always end with a kiss or more.\n\nMy friends are horrified. They say I could be injured and that any man who would physically \"fight\" a woman is a potential wife-beater or worse.\n\nSo many people have warned me to \"watch out\" that now I'm beginning to wonder. To me, it's a good way to have fun and burn off calories. What's your take on this, Abby?",
    "abbyResponse": "If you are the one initiating these \"fights,\" then I doubt that your boyfriend is a potential wife-beater or worse. (If it were the other way around, I might be concerned.) What you have described sounds more like foreplay than abuse. As long as you both enjoy it and no one becomes injured, what the two of you do is nobody's business, so keep it private.",
    "aiResponse": "It's important to remember that physical activity, including wrestling, can be a fun and healthy way to bond with your partner and burn calories. However, it's also important to make sure that both partners are comfortable with the activity and that it is conducted in a safe and consensual manner. It's not okay for one partner to use physical force or aggression in a way that could cause harm or make the other partner feel uncomfortable or unsafe.\n\nIt's also important to be mindful of the potential for injury when engaging in physical activity, and to take steps to minimize the risk of injury. This might include wearing protective gear, following proper safety guidelines, and stopping the activity if anyone is injured or if it stops being enjoyable for either partner.\n\nFinally, it's not appropriate for anyone to make assumptions about someone's character based on their hobbies or interests. It's not fair to label someone as a potential abuser simply because they enjoy physical activity with their partner. It's important to remember that healthy relationships are built on trust, respect, and communication, and that it's never okay for one partner to use physical force or aggression in a harmful or abusive way."

Apparently, her mother and my father are siblings. When I asked my father about it, he got very defensive and told me whoever it was I spoke to is a complete and total liar. Ordinarily, I might have agreed, but his reaction tells me there's a lot more to this.\n\nI want to find out more. Neither of my parents will say a word about it, and I don't know why. When I told them I plan to travel to the East Coast and meet Bree, I was told I may not be welcomed back if I do! This makes me wonder what horrible thing could have happened that would make a father consider disowning his son.\n\nBecause my father won't share the truth with me, I am left with only this option. Pursue this, find part of my family I never knew existed and learn something, but lose the family I have and regret it forever. Any insight?",
    "abbyResponse": "I can offer insight, but not a roadmap for how to proceed. Family secrets can be devastating. That your father reacted so strongly shows how threatened he is that you might uncover something he isn't proud of.\n\nAs a college graduate, I am sure you are familiar with the myth about Pandora's box.

I make twice what he does, but I prefer saving for the obvious debt in my future and taking shorter, less-expensive vacations. He relies on his \"strategic financial planning\" to compensate for his \"I want it all, and I want it now\" personality.\n\nWhen I express my hesitancy to go on these long trips based on my personal finances, he offers to pay for everything, which makes me feel like a cheapskate, since I could technically pay for us both easily.

    "abbyResponse": "Oh, how I wish you had revealed more information about your boyfriend's \"strategic financial planning\" because I'm sure many people would be very interested. However, if he's investing in the stock market, he should know that it's like an elevator -- investments not only can go up, but they also can come down, and there are no guarantees regarding investment results.\n\nBefore this relationship goes further, I URGE you and your boyfriend to seek not only couples counseling but also financial counseling. Few things are more destructive to a marriage than money woes, and you both need someone to explain exactly what the philosophy of \"I want it all, and I want it now\" will mean for your future.",

It's also important to consider your personal financial goals and values when making decisions about how to spend your money.\n\nIt sounds like your boyfriend has a different approach to financial planning and is more comfortable spending money on lavish vacations. It's important to have open and honest communication with your partner about your financial goals and values, and to try to find a way to balance your financial priorities as a couple.\n\nOne option you could consider is having a candid conversation with your boyfriend about your concerns.

Recently my oldest sister, \"Eva,\" moved back to this area and says she intends to plant a yellow rose bush on Mom's grave, because yellow roses were her favorite flower.\n\nI don't think live roses are appropriate on a grave, so I asked the cemetery attendant about it. He told me no one had ever made such a request, but he was unaware of any policy about planting flowers on graves. He's a friend of the family, so I'm sure he won't tell Eva that she can't plant a rose bush. He did comment that the bush would have to be kept pruned so that it wouldn't interfere with mowing.\n\nAbby, would I be out of line to ask my sister not to follow through on her plan? The grave is near the center of our family plot, and I think the bush would be out of place. And who would be responsible for the care of the roses? I have taken pride in how Mother's grave has looked all these years, but I don't want to take care of a live plant. Couldn't Eva just plant a rose bush in her own yard and dedicate it to Mom?\n\nDon't advise me to take a family vote. One brother agrees with Eva; the other agrees with me. What is your opinion of a rose bush on a grave?",
    "abbyResponse": "As long as the cemetery has no policy about live plants on graves and your sister agrees to be responsible for the upkeep, I see no reason why a yellow rose bush wouldn't be lovely on your mother's grave.\n\nShould your sister not live up to the agreement to tend the roses, you could replace the bush with the artificial flowers you prefer.\n\nAsk yourself: \"What would Mama say about this?\" and be prepared to compromise.",

It's also natural to have different ideas about what is appropriate for a grave and to have different ways of remembering and honoring a loved one.\n\nOne option you could consider is having a candid conversation with your sister Eva about your concerns. You could explain that you appreciate her desire to honor your mother and to plant a rose bush on the grave, but that you have reservations about the idea. You could express your concerns about the maintenance of the rose bush and the potential for it to be out of place in the family plot.\n\nIt might be helpful to try to find a way to compromise or to come up with an alternative solution that takes both of your concerns into account.
