    "concern": "I have been concerned about my parents for some time now. They are elderly and live in a retirement community. They have a very nice home and don't have to worry about money.\n\nThe problem is, they drink every day -- sometimes from noon to when they go to bed. Many times, their drinking has caused arguments and police visits. When I express my concern about their drinking, they tell me to stay out of it, mind my own business, and they're retired and have earned the right to do whatever they want.\n\nI don't mind them having cocktails every now and then, but this has gotten out of hand. I think they have become alcoholics and only bad things are coming of it. They refuse to listen to me, or anybody else, for that matter. What should I do?",
    "abbyResponse": "As people age, their bodies are sometimes less able to metabolize alcohol than they were when they were younger. When things get out of hand to the extent that the police are being called, I agree something must be done. Because there is this level of disruption going on, it follows that the neighbors in that very nice retirement community must be less than thrilled.,\n\nThat your parents drink is only part of the problem. Elderly people can suffer from balance problems even when they are sober. It is common for someone who is inebriated to fall, which could cause your mom or dad to suffer serious injury.,\n\nIf other family members are also worried about your folks, an intervention might be in order. Before attempting one, attend some Al-Anon meetings so you can listen to others' similar experiences and learn how they were handled. Visit www.al-anon.alateen.org, or call 1-888-4-ALANON to find a meeting near you.",
    "aiResponse": "It sounds like you are in a very difficult situation and are concerned about your parents' well-being. It can be frustrating and heartbreaking when loved ones refuse to listen to our concerns or make changes that we believe are necessary for their health and safety.\n\nThere are a few things you can try in this situation:\n\nSeek support for yourself: It can be emotionally draining to try to help someone who is not ready to accept help. Make sure to take care of yourself and seek support from friends, family, or a professional therapist to help you cope with the stress and frustration you are feeling.\n\nGather information and resources: Learn more about alcoholism and how to approach the subject with your parents. There are many resources available, such as the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (NCADD) and Al-Anon, a support group for family and friends of alcoholics.\n\nHave a calm and non-confrontational conversation with your parents: It may be helpful to have a conversation with your parents about your concerns in a calm and non-judgmental way. Avoid lecturing or criticizing them, and instead focus on expressing your love and concern for them. Let them know that you are available to support them if they decide they want to make a change.\n\nConsider staging an intervention: If your efforts to communicate with your parents have not been successful, you may want to consider staging an intervention with the help of a professional interventionist. An intervention is a structured process in which a person's friends and family confront the person about their problem behavior and offer support and assistance in seeking treatment.\n\nIt's important to remember that ultimately, the decision to change their behavior is up to your parents. You can offer support and encouragement, but you cannot force them to make a change."

    "concern": "My daughter says her children, ages 11 and 8, are afraid of me because I correct their lack of manners. Is asking them to say \"please\" and \"thank you,\" or to use a knife to cut things on their plate into small pieces rather than have food hanging out of their mouths, really expecting too much?\n\nIf their parents don't care, who will teach them? While I no longer expect people to keep their arms off the table, what are the minimal standards I should expect at a dinner table these days? Or am I expected to watch slobs sprawled over the table, picking at their food with their hands and chewing with their mouths open?",
    "abbyResponse": "Sometimes it isn't what we say, as much as how we say it. I see nothing wrong with reminding children to use their manners and explaining what they are. But if you are doing it in such a way that your grandchildren are afraid of you, it may be time to work on your delivery",
    "aiResponse": "It is not unreasonable to expect children to have basic table manners, such as using utensils and saying \"please\" and \"thank you.\" These are important social skills that help children interact with others in a respectful and polite way. It is understandable that you want to teach your grandchildren good manners and that you may feel frustrated if they are not using them.\n\nThat being said, it is important to remember that children, especially young ones, may not always remember to use good manners, especially if they are not used to being corrected or if they have not had much practice using them. It is important to be patient and to remember that children learn through repetition and positive reinforcement.\n\nOne way to teach good table manners is to model the behavior you want to see. When you are at the dinner table, use good manners yourself and make a point to thank others for passing the food or for cooking the meal. You can also give your grandchildren gentle reminders to use good manners, such as saying \"Remember to say 'please' when you ask for something.\"\n\nIt is also important to remember that children may be afraid of you if you are consistently correcting their behavior or if you are overly critical. It may be helpful to try to find a balance between setting expectations for behavior and being understanding and patient with your grandchildren as they learn and grow."
